# Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile Solution

This is a solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). This project allows users to view a profile card with social media links and helps improve front-end development skills by using React, Tailwind CSS, and modern web development practices.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a profile card with social links
- See hover states for all interactive elements
- Adapt to different screen sizes for better responsiveness

### Screenshot

)

This is a simple profile card that includes an avatar, name, location, and links to social platforms. It showcases responsive design and hover states for the buttons. The screenshot above shows the profile card on a standard viewport.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Flexbox for layout
- React for component-based UI

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned to combine **Tailwind CSS** with React to create a responsive and visually appealing design with minimal custom CSS. One of the key aspects I practiced was using Tailwind's responsive utility classes to ensure the design works on both mobile and larger screens.

Here are a few key code snippets:

```jsx
<img
  src={face}
  alt="jessica.jpeg"
  className="mx-auto h-16 w-auto rounded-full"
/>
```

### Continued development
Moving forward, I plan to continue working on accessibility and optimizing responsive designs for larger screens. I also want to explore more animations and transitions in React and Tailwind CSS for smoother user experiences.

### Useful Resources
Tailwind CSS Documentation - The official Tailwind documentation was very helpful to understand the utility-first approach to styling.
React Documentation - The React docs are always a great resource for understanding component structures and lifecycle methods.
